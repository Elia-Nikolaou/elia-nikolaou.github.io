# 11 February — Women and Girls in STEM

I grew up on an island that teaches you two lessons early: how wide the horizon is 🌊, and how quickly people try to draw lines on it.  
In a place that is European, connected, and proud, you expect the path into science to feel straightforward, because why wouldn’t it?

You expect role models to be visible. You expect curiosity to be welcomed.  
You expect computers, research, technology, engineering to feel like rooms you can walk into, without having to explain why you’re there.

And yet, for many girls, the barriers are not dramatic.

They are **quiet**.

## The quiet barriers — the reality

Cyprus can hurt you.

Not loudly. Not with doors slammed in your face.  
More often it’s the quiet kind of hurt that’s easy to dismiss and hard to forget:

- a raised eyebrow when you answer with certainty  
- a “harmless” comment that lands like a weight  
- a pause before someone says *yes*, as if your curiosity needs permission  

We say there’s no difference between genders, and you know, maybe we even believe it.  
Yet girls still learn the same invisible rules:

- be brilliant, but not too loud  
- be ambitious, but not too much  
- take up space, but only the kind that doesn’t make anyone uncomfortable  

These are not “small things.” In academic language, they are **micro-frictions**: subtle signals that shape confidence, belonging, and persistence over time.

And science cannot afford that loss. **Not morally, and not intellectually**.

---

## The people who make science possible

My story includes something equally real: educators who made science feel like belonging.

There are teachers who teach content, and there are teachers who teach *courage*.  
They treat questions as evidence of thinking, not disruption.  
They allow failure to be part of the method, not a verdict on ability.

They set standards high enough to be meaningful and support strong enough to be sustainable.

In those classrooms, confidence isn’t a personality trait.  
It becomes a **skill you practice**.

Those educators don’t just help students succeed. They help students **stay**.

And staying matters, because scientific progress is rarely one moment of brilliance.  
It’s persistence. It’s revision.  
It’s learning to live with “not yet” without turning it into “not me.”

## ✨ A lineage of women who changed what “possible” means

When we talk about women in science, we too often use the tone of *exception*:  
the rare genius, the inspiring outlier, the surprising success story.

But women have always been here.

> **Marie Curie** didn’t become a symbol because her path was easy.  
> She became one because her work was undeniable, and because she insisted on belonging in a world that tried to treat her brilliance as an anomaly.

And **Ada Lovelace**, long before “computer science” was a common phrase, saw something radical:  
that computation could be more than calculation, it could be **imagination made formal**.  
A bridge between logic and creativity. A language for building futures.

Between them, and beyond them, are countless women whose stories weren’t amplified at the volume they deserved.  
Not because they were missing.

Because recognition was.

So when a girl today asks a hard question, or writes her first line of code, or refuses to shrink her ambition, she isn’t “breaking into” STEM from the outside.

She’s **continuing** it.

## Why I love science (and why it matters)

I didn’t fall in love with science as a label. I fell in love with it as a feeling.

The moment a concept finally clicks and the world becomes more legible.  
The discipline of testing, failing, and refining.  
The particular kind of joy when you build something — an experiment, a model, a piece of code — and it works, not by luck, but because you understood enough to make it real.

At its best, STEM is not cold. It is **deeply human**:  
a rigorous way of caring about truth, and a practical way of improving the world.

This is why 11 February matters: a reminder that participation in science is not distributed purely by talent.  
It is shaped by culture, by expectation, by who is encouraged, by who is doubted, by who is given room to become.

## A promise we should be able to keep

Women and girls in science should not be framed as exceptions, inspirations, or surprises.  
I want them to be ordinary, present, expected, visible.  
I want “she’s good at this” to sound as unremarkable as it is true.

And I want the next generation to inherit a different kind of island:  
one where the horizon is not a metaphor, but a policy, built into classrooms, hiring decisions, mentorship, and daily language.

Because change is not abstract. It looks like:

- inviting girls into the “hard” questions (and expecting them to answer)  
- crediting their work, citing their ideas, amplifying their voice  
- mentoring early, consistently, and without conditions  
- designing spaces where belonging is the default, not a reward

## For the youngest minds

To the young children, those who mix colors just to see what happens, who stack blocks to test gravity, who press buttons to learn cause and effect, who ask “why” until the room runs out of air - **keep going**.

That instinct is not random. It is the beginning of scientific thinking.

One day you’ll learn the formal words: science, technology, engineering, mathematics.  
But you already know the foundation:

> **wonder, followed by effort.**

And to every girl reading this: your curiosity is not “extra.”  
It is not “too much.” It is not something to soften.

It is a signal, clear, intelligent, and brave.

Keep asking. Keep building. Keep trying again.  
**You can be whatever you dream.**  
A scientist. An engineer. A researcher. A builder. A creator.

Because the future is not something we wait for.  
It’s something we test, refine, and create **together**.
